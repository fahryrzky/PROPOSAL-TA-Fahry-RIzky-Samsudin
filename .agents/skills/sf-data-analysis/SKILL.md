name: sf-data-analysis
description: Use when executing and reporting the analysis for a Social Forces (SF) manuscript so it survives expert, double-anonymized review — honest uncertainty, robustness, and triangulation appropriate to quantitative, demographic, network, or computational work. Guides analysis norms; it does not fabricate results.

# Data Analysis (sf-data-analysis)

Social Forces built its standing on **methodological rigor**, and its reviewers are sophisticated. The
analysis must report uncertainty honestly, probe robustness that could actually break the result, and
stay reproducible. This skill covers execution and reporting norms; design decisions live in
`sf-research-design`. Keep an eye on the exhibit budget — results must fit within **10 tables and
figure panels** (see `sf-tables-figures`).

## When to trigger

- Running main and supporting analyses; building the results section
- A reviewer asked for robustness, heterogeneity, or alternative specifications
- Reconciling confirmatory vs. exploratory analyses
- Making the analysis reproducible before drafting the data availability statement

## Analysis norms SF expects

1. **Report uncertainty honestly.** Confidence/credible intervals, not just stars; the magnitude and
   substantive meaning of the estimate, not just its significance.
2. **Robustness that probes, not decorates.** Show specifications that could *break* the result
   (alternative measures, samples, estimators, fixed effects), and say what you learn.
3. **Heterogeneity with discipline.** Pre-specify subgroups where possible; correct for multiple
   comparisons; do not mine for a significant interaction and theorize it post hoc.
4. **Right inference.** Cluster at the assignment/sampling level; use survey weights and design-based
   inference for complex samples; small-cluster corrections (wild-cluster bootstrap) when clusters are few.
5. **Measurement.** Validate constructs; report reliability; show the result is not an artifact of a
   coding/scaling choice.
6. **Missing data.** Be explicit — multiple imputation or principled handling, not silent listwise
   deletion that changes the sample.

## Demographic / computational / network specifics
- Demographic: report standardization/decomposition choices; handle censoring and competing risks.
- Computational/text: document model/version, hyperparameters, seeds; validate against human labels.
- Network: state the null/baseline; report sensitivity to boundary and tie-definition choices.

## Reproducibility while you work (not at the end)
- One **master script** regenerates every table and figure from the (raw or constructed) data.
- **Set and report seeds** for bootstrap, simulation, imputation, and any stochastic step.
- Pin software/package versions (`renv.lock`, `requirements.txt`, recorded `ssc`/`net` installs).
- Keep table/figure numbers matched to script outputs — and feed the **data availability statement**
  (see `sf-data-and-transparency`).

## Anti-patterns

- Stars-only tables with no effect sizes or intervals
- "Robustness" that only reruns near-identical specs to manufacture stability
- p-hacking / fishing for a significant interaction; HARKing exploratory results into hypotheses
- Ignoring survey weights/design, or clustering at the wrong level
- A results section whose numbers the code cannot reproduce

## Output format

```
【Main estimate】magnitude + interval + substantive meaning
【Identification check】(per research-design) result
【Robustness】specs that could break it → what held
【Heterogeneity】pre-specified? MHT-adjusted?
【Inference】weights/clustering/few-cluster handled correctly? [Y/N]
【Reproducible】master script + seeds + pinned versions? [Y/N]
【Next】sf-tables-figures
```
