name: io-submission
description: Use when running the final pre-submission preflight for International Organization (IO) via Editorial Manager — article-type selection, double-blind preparation (third-person self-citation), word caps, separate abstract/word-count/acknowledgments, short author-date footnotes, supplementary material (~20 pages), ORCID, and the Data Availability Statement. Final checks; it does not draft content.

# Submission Preflight (io-submission)

The last check before pressing submit on **Editorial Manager**. IO is **double-blind**, so the single
most common avoidable failure is a manuscript that reveals the author through first-person
self-references. Verify volatile specifics on the official page before relying on them.

## When to trigger

- "Submitting tomorrow" — last pass before upload
- Unsure which files/metadata Editorial Manager expects
- Confirming the chosen article type's cap is met and the manuscript is properly anonymized

## Process facts (verify volatile items on the official page)

- **Owner / publisher:** **IO Foundation** / **Cambridge University Press**.
- **Portal:** **Editorial Manager** (confirm the current URL).
- **Review model:** **double-blind** — anonymize the manuscript; provide a separate title page.
- **Article types:** Research Article (**≤ 14,000 words**), Research Note (**≤ 8,000**), Essay
  (**≤ 10,000**). Word limits **include tables, figures, and notes**; **exclude the bibliography**.
- **Abstract / word count / acknowledgments:** submitted **separately** from the manuscript (abstract
  word cap not numerically confirmed — 待核实).
- **Self-citation:** after the title page, **omit identity-revealing self-references**; cite your own
  work in the **third person**.
- **Footnotes / style:** accepted manuscripts use **short author-date footnotes**; consistent style.
- **Supplementary material:** **should rarely exceed twenty pages**, especially at initial submission.
- **ORCID:** required for the **corresponding author**.
- **Data:** **none at initial submission**; requested at **conditional acceptance**; verified by IO
  staff before final acceptance; **Data Availability Statement** before the reference list.
- **Fee:** no submission fee stated (待核实; confirm any post-acceptance OA APC).

## Preflight checklist

### Article type & length
- [ ] Type chosen and its word cap met (Article ≤ 14,000 / Note ≤ 8,000 / Essay ≤ 10,000)
- [ ] Word count **includes tables/figures/notes; excludes bibliography** — recomputed on that basis
- [ ] Abstract, word count, and acknowledgments prepared as **separate** items

### Anonymity (double-blind)
- [ ] No author names, affiliations, or acknowledgments inside the manuscript
- [ ] **Third-person self-citation** after the title page; no "as we showed in…"
- [ ] Identifying **file metadata stripped** (document properties, comments)
- [ ] Anonymized pre-analysis plan / OSF link if preregistration is referenced
- [ ] Separate (non-anonymous) title page prepared as a distinct file

### Format & metadata
- [ ] Short author-date footnotes; consistent citation style
- [ ] Corresponding-author **ORCID** ready
- [ ] **Data Availability Statement** placed before the reference list
- [ ] Supplementary material within the ~20-page norm; figures/tables self-contained (see `io-tables-figures`)

### Compliance & verification-readiness
- [ ] Ethics / IRB / human-subjects compliance where applicable
- [ ] Original work; preprint status checked against Cambridge preprint policy
- [ ] Reproducibility package + formal-proof appendix **staged** so IO staff can verify after conditional acceptance (see `io-transparency-and-data-policy`)

## Anti-patterns

- First-person self-references or author identifiers left in the text/metadata (breaks double-blind)
- Counting words without tables/figures/notes (IO includes them; bibliography is excluded)
- Putting the abstract/acknowledgments inside the manuscript instead of submitting them separately
- Sending a long paper into the Research Note (≤ 8,000) type
- Supplementary material far over ~20 pages at initial submission

## Output format

```
【Type】Research Article / Research Note / Essay (cap met? Y/N)
【Anonymized】third-person self-cites + metadata clean? [Y/N]
【Abstract/word-count/acknowledgments separate】[Y/N]
【Word count basis】incl. tables/figures/notes, excl. bibliography? [Y/N]
【Footnotes + ORCID + DAS】[Y/N]
【Repro + proofs staged for verification】[Y/N]
【Next】await decision → io-rebuttal on R&R
```
