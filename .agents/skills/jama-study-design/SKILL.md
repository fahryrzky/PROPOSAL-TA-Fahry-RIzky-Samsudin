# Study Design & Internal Validity (jama-study-design)

## When to trigger

- Choosing or defending the design: RCT vs cohort vs case-control vs diagnostic
- A reviewer will ask whether the analysis is intention-to-treat or per-protocol
- Bias, confounding, or missing data threaten the primary inference
- The design and the reporting checklist need to be aligned before writing

## Design-specific safeguards JAMA reviewers expect

### Randomized clinical trials
- A single, **pre-specified primary outcome**; secondary outcomes clearly labeled
- Adequate randomization (sequence generation) and **allocation concealment**
- Blinding of participants, clinicians, outcome assessors where feasible — state what was blinded
- **Intention-to-treat** as the primary analysis; per-protocol only as secondary/sensitivity
- A priori **sample-size / power** calculation tied to the primary outcome
- Pre-defined stopping rules and handling of interim analyses

### Cohort / case-control (observational)
- Explicit **confounding** control: prespecified covariates, adjustment strategy, DAG reasoning
- Clear definitions of exposure, outcome, and follow-up windows; avoid immortal-time bias
- Selection-bias and information-bias appraisal; how participants entered the sample
- **Association, not causation** — design and language must respect this

### Diagnostic-accuracy studies
- Pre-specified reference standard, applied to all participants, blinded to index test
- Consecutive or random enrollment; report spectrum of disease
- Pre-defined thresholds; report sensitivity/specificity/predictive values with CIs

### Systematic reviews / meta-analyses
- Pre-registered protocol (e.g., PROSPERO), pre-specified eligibility and outcomes
- Comprehensive, reproducible search; duplicate screening and extraction
- Risk-of-bias assessment; pre-planned heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses

## Decision table

| Question                                                  | Design / action                         |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Does an intervention cause an outcome?                    | RCT; if infeasible, strong quasi-design |
| What is the prognosis / risk of an exposure?              | Prospective cohort with confounder plan |
| How accurate is a test?                                   | Diagnostic-accuracy study (vs reference)|
| What does the totality of evidence show?                  | Systematic review ± meta-analysis       |
| Rare outcome, exposure already occurred                   | Case-control (watch selection bias)     |

## Checklist

- [ ] Primary outcome is single, pre-specified, patient-relevant
- [ ] For RCTs: randomization, allocation concealment, blinding stated; ITT is primary
- [ ] Sample-size / power calculation present and tied to the primary outcome
- [ ] Confounding/bias strategy explicit and pre-specified (observational)
- [ ] Reference standard and blinding defined (diagnostic)
- [ ] Protocol pre-registered (RCT and systematic review)
- [ ] Missing-data handling pre-specified (not improvised post hoc)
- [ ] Design choice matches the EQUATOR checklist you will use

## Anti-patterns

- Promoting a secondary or post hoc outcome to "primary" after seeing results
- Per-protocol analysis presented as primary for an RCT
- "Adjusted for everything" with no pre-specified covariate rationale
- Causal claims from an observational design
- Reference standard chosen or applied after knowing the index-test result
- No power calculation, then attributing a null result to "trends"
