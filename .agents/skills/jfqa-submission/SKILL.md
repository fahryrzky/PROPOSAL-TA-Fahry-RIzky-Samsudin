description: Final pre-submission preflight for the Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis (JFQA) via Editorial Manager — text-searchable single PDF, 8.5x11 / 1-inch / 12-pt Times New Roman double-spaced formatting, double-anonymous anonymization, the 100-word abstract cap, the $350 fee, prior-rejection disclosure to avoid the one-year ban, and code-sharing exception timing. Final checks; it does not draft content.

# JFQA Submission Preflight (jfqa-submission)

Run this before pressing submit on **Editorial Manager** (`editorialmanager.com/jfqa/`). JFQA requires an account **separate** from a Cambridge Core account.

## Process facts (verify on the official page)

- Published by **Cambridge University Press** for the **University of Washington Foster School of Business**.
- **$350** fee, credit card only; **$275 refunded** if the paper is not sent to a reviewer (a desk reject keeps **$75**). **Double-anonymous** review; the text-searchable PDF goes blind to reviewer(s). No fixed length limit, but over-long papers are likely desk-rejected.

## Preflight checklist

### Manuscript & formatting
- [ ] Single **text-searchable PDF** (no image-only pages, no separate figure files).
- [ ] **8.5 × 11** paper, **1-inch** margins, **12-pt Times New Roman**, **double-spaced** body and appendices.
- [ ] **Abstract**: one paragraph, **≤ 100 words** (see jfqa-contribution-framing).
- [ ] Tables/figures embedded, numbered, with self-contained notes (see jfqa-tables-figures).

### Anonymization (double-anonymous — required)
- [ ] No author names, affiliations, or acknowledgments in the PDF.
- [ ] Self-citations phrased neutrally; PDF metadata scrubbed of author identity.

### Disclosures & resubmission rule
- [ ] If this paper was **previously rejected by JFQA** and substantially modified, the **cover letter explicitly discloses the prior rejection** — failing to do so triggers desk rejection **and a one-year submission ban** for the corresponding author.
- [ ] Confirmed not under review elsewhere.

### Code-sharing timing
- [ ] If you need a **code-sharing exception** (e.g., delayed release for confidential data), it is requested **on this initial submission** — not later (see jfqa-replication-and-data-policy).

## Anti-patterns

- Image-only PDF; abstract over 100 words; wrong font/margins/spacing; author identity left in text or metadata.
- Resubmitting a previously rejected paper without disclosing it (one-year ban); requesting a code-sharing exception only after submission.
