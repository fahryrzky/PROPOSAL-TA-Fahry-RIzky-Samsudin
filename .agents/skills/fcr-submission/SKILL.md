name: fcr-submission
description: Use when running the final pre-submission preflight for Field Crops Research (FCR) via Editorial Manager — article-type selection, abstract (~400 words) and highlights (3-5 bullets of <=85 characters), complete agronomic reporting, data-availability statement, generative-AI declaration, Elsevier formatting, and the cover letter. Final checks; it does not draft content.

# Submission Preflight (fcr-submission)

The last check before pressing submit on **Editorial Manager**. FCR's most common avoidable failures
are **scope mismatch** and **incomplete reporting / declarations**. Verify volatile specifics on the
official Elsevier guide before relying on them (live page may 403 to automated tools — see
`../../resources/official-source-map.md`).

## When to trigger

- "Submitting tomorrow" — last pass before upload
- Unsure which files/metadata Editorial Manager expects
- Confirming scope fit, format, and declarations are complete

## Process facts (verify volatile items on the official page)

- **Publisher:** Elsevier (ISSN **0378-4290**).
- **Portal:** **Editorial Manager** (confirm current URL on the live guide).
- **Review model:** **single anonymized** — typically ≥ 2 reviewers.
- **Article types:** Original Research Paper · Short Communication · Review (usually invited) · Opinion
  Paper · Loomis Review (invited).
- **Abstract:** **≤ ~400 words** (待核实 exact cap).
- **Highlights:** **3–5 bullets, each ≤ 85 characters** including spaces.
- **Multi-environment rule:** field experiments should span **≥ 2 seasons and/or multiple
  environments** (unless exceptional circumstances are justified).
- **Data availability:** must be **stated at submission**.
- **Generative AI:** **declare any use** in manuscript preparation.

## Preflight checklist

### Scope & type
- [ ] Field-based, multi-season/-environment, a field crop, generally significant (see `fcr-topic-selection`)
- [ ] Article type chosen; Review/Opinion proposal cleared with editors if required

### Manuscript & format
- [ ] Abstract ≤ ~400 words; states purpose, environments, quantitative result, conclusion
- [ ] **3–5 highlights**, each ≤ 85 characters, findings not topics
- [ ] Structure: focused intro → complete methods → concise results → interpretive discussion
- [ ] SI units; consistent Elsevier/FCR reference style; grammatically sound English
- [ ] Figures/tables self-contained with units and **SED/LSD/CI** (see `fcr-figures-and-tables`)

### Reporting completeness
- [ ] Crop/cultivar, sites/seasons, soil, **weather vs. phenology**, management, design, statistics
- [ ] Yield data included/linked to biophysical process where relevant

### Declarations & files
- [ ] **Data-availability statement** drafted (shared + repository/ID, or restricted + reason)
- [ ] **Generative-AI** use declared; CRediT roles, funding, competing interests
- [ ] Cover letter establishing scope fit + contribution (see `fcr-cover-letter`)
- [ ] Co-submission to **Data in Brief / MethodsX** considered if relevant

## Anti-patterns

- Submitting controlled-environment-only or single-site/single-season work
- Abstract over length; highlights that are topics or exceed 85 characters
- Methods missing soil/weather-vs-phenology/management (not reproducible)
- Blank data-availability statement; missing generative-AI declaration
- A discussion that repeats results; means with no error term

## Output format

```
【Scope & type】field-based + ≥2 seasons/envs + field crop + general; type chosen? [Y/N]
【Abstract & highlights】≤~400 words; 3-5 bullets ≤85 chars? [Y/N]
【Reporting complete】cultivar/site/soil/weather-vs-phenology/management/design/stats? [Y/N]
【Declarations】data availability + generative-AI + CRediT/funding? [Y/N]
【Cover letter】scope fit + contribution stated? [Y/N]
【Next】await decision → fcr-revision-and-rebuttal on a revise verdict
```
