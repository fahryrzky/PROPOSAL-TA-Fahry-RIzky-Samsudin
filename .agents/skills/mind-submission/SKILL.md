description: Use when running the final pre-submission preflight for Mind via ScholarOne — preparation for triple-anonymous review, the ~8,000-word limit, the 50–200-word abstract, line numbering, the one-article-per-12-months rule, file format, and the MIND house style. Final checks; it does not draft content.

# Submission Preflight (mind-submission)

The last check before submitting on **ScholarOne**. Mind is **triple-anonymous**, so the single most
common avoidable failure is a manuscript that is not properly prepared for anonymous review — such a
paper **will not be read**. Verify volatile specifics on the official page before relying on them.

## When to trigger

- "Submitting tomorrow" — last pass before upload
- Unsure which files / settings ScholarOne expects
- Confirming the word limit, abstract, line numbering, and anonymization are all in order

## Process facts (verify volatile items on the official page)

- **Owner / publisher:** Mind Association / Oxford University Press.
- **Portal:** **ScholarOne** (`mc.manuscriptcentral.com/MIND`); submit in **Word or PDF**, with
  high-resolution image files sent at the same time.
- **Review model:** **triple-anonymous** — author identity hidden from editors and referees until
  acceptance; prepare the manuscript for anonymous refereeing or it will not be read.
- **Length:** articles **~8,000 words total**; longer only in **exceptional circumstances** (e.g.,
  very extensive quotations); symbol-heavy papers should paginate like an 8,000-word article.
- **Abstract:** published abstract **50–200 words**; a longer submission abstract (up to ~250 words,
  待核实) may be included to aid review.
- **Submission limit:** **no more than one article per corresponding author per 12-month period**.
- **Line numbering:** **required** for the review copy (LaTeX `lineno`; Word line-numbering option).
- **Style:** the **MIND house style / MIND Stylesheet** applies to the **accepted** final version.
- **Fee:** no submission fee stated; optional open-access charge handled by OUP after acceptance (待核实).

## Preflight checklist

### Type & length
- [ ] Content type chosen (article / discussion / book review / critical notice)
- [ ] Article ~8,000 words (or justified exception); symbol-heavy paper paginated equivalently
- [ ] Abstract within the stated length (published 50–200 words)

### Anonymity (triple-anonymous)
- [ ] No author names, affiliations, or revealing acknowledgements in the manuscript
- [ ] No self-identifying references ("as I argued in…"); self-citations neutralized
- [ ] Identifying **file metadata stripped** (document properties)

### Preparation & format
- [ ] **Line numbering** on the document (LaTeX `lineno` / Word)
- [ ] Word or PDF; high-resolution image files ready to upload at the same time
- [ ] Consistent citation style (full MIND house-style conversion at acceptance — see `mind-citation-and-style`)
- [ ] Alt text for figures; funding declared where applicable

### Eligibility & compliance
- [ ] Not in breach of the **one-article-per-12-months** corresponding-author rule
- [ ] Original, unpublished work; aware of the OUP copyright licence signed at acceptance

## Anti-patterns

- Uploading a manuscript that reveals the author (triple-anonymous — it will not be read)
- Omitting line numbers from the review copy
- An abstract outside the stated range, or an article well over ~8,000 words with no justification
- Submitting a second article within twelve months as the same corresponding author
- Assuming a default reference export already matches the MIND house style

## Output format

```
【Type】Article / Discussion / Book review / Critical notice (length ok? Y/N)
【Anonymized】text + self-refs + file metadata clean? [Y/N]
【Line numbering】present? [Y/N]
【Abstract】word count (50–200 published)
【12-month rule】clear? [Y/N]
【Format】Word/PDF + images + alt text ready? [Y/N]
【Next】await decision → mind-revision-and-response
```
