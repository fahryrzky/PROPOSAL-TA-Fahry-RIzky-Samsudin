name: pom-methods
description: Use when selecting or auditing the method for a Production and Operations Management (POM) manuscript — analytical modeling (optimization, stochastic models, game theory), empirical identification, behavioral experiments, simulation, or operations data science. Matches method to the operations question; it does not execute the analysis (pom-data-analysis).

# Method Fit (pom-methods)

## When to trigger

- The method may not match the operations question (level, uncertainty, causality)
- You must choose between an analytical model, an empirical design, an experiment, or a data pipeline
- A reviewer says "the method does not support the claim" or "this is a methods paper, not OM"

## POM mandates no single method — but the method must fit and be rigorous

POM explicitly places **no restriction on research methods**, while being historically anchored in analytical modeling. Pick the method the *question* demands, and route to the matching Department.

| Operations question / claim                                  | Method                                                              |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Optimal policy under cost/service objective                  | Optimization (LP/MIP/convex, dynamic programming); characterize the policy |
| Decisions under demand/lead-time uncertainty                 | Stochastic modeling, queueing, inventory theory, MDP/ADP           |
| Strategic interaction (suppliers, competitors, platforms)    | Game theory (Nash/Stackelberg); prove equilibrium existence/uniqueness |
| Causal operational effect from field data                    | Empirical OM: DiD, IV, RD, matching with a clear identification strategy |
| Human operational decision bias                              | Behavioral/experimental OM (lab/online); randomization, manipulation checks |
| Systems too complex for closed form                          | Discrete-event simulation; validation, warm-up, replications, CIs  |
| Prediction feeding an operational decision                   | Operations data science (ML / forecasting), tied to a decision/loss |

## What each track must defend

- **Analytical:** assumptions grounded in operations reality; solution concept; structural results; sensitivity/comparative statics; managerial interpretation. Robustness = relaxing key assumptions, not just numerical examples.
- **Empirical OM:** identification (what makes the effect causal), measurement in decision-relevant units, unit of analysis, external validity to other operations settings.
- **Behavioral OM:** design, incentives, randomization, manipulation and attention checks, and **operational realism** (does the lab task map to a real operations decision?).
- **Operations data science:** validation design, leakage checks, and — critically — the **operational value**: does a better prediction change a feasible policy (predict-then-optimize)?
- **Simulation:** parameter provenance, validation against known cases, sensitivity, and a replication package.

## The POM bar on method

A method exists to serve an **OM contribution** judged interesting to practicing managers. If the paper's value is mainly a technical advance with thin OM decision content, a methods journal may fit better. Keep heavy derivations, solver details, and extra robustness for the unlimited online **e-companion** so the 32-page main document stays focused.

## Checklist

- [ ] Method matches the operations question and the target Department

- [ ] Empirical: identification strategy and decision-relevant measurement stated
- [ ] Behavioral: randomization, manipulation checks, operational realism
- [ ] Data science: validation, leakage, and decision/operational value
- [ ] Derivations/extra material slated for the e-companion
