name: jpube-rebuttal
description: Use when a Journal of Public Economics (JPubE) decision letter arrives (revision or reject) and a response strategy, response letter, or appeal decision is needed. Structures the revision and response for single-anonymized specialist review; it does not redo the analysis (route to the relevant jpube-* skill).

# Rebuttal & Revision (jpube-rebuttal)

## When to trigger

- A JPubE decision letter arrived: major/minor revision, or reject
- You have specialist referee reports and need a response strategy
- You are unsure how to prioritize conflicting public-finance referee demands
- You are weighing whether to use the single permitted appeal

## JPubE reality

JPubE uses **single anonymized review** with a minimum of two reviewers who **know your identity**, and the handling editor (under Co-Editors-in-Chief Friedman and Kopczuk) synthesizes their reports through **Editorial Manager**. The **handling editor's letter is the contract**: it ranks which referee points are binding. Because referees are public-finance specialists, expect demands aimed at the *credibility of the policy parameter and its welfare mapping* — the counterfactual in a bunching design, the pre-trends in a reform DID, the sufficient-statistics assumptions, the external validity of a local elasticity.

## Triage protocol

1. **Decode the editor.** A point the editor underscores is binding; a single-referee point the editor passed over is lower priority (but still answer it).
2. **Classify every comment** as *fundamental* (needs new analysis), *clarification* (rewrite/explain), or *disagreement* (push back politely with evidence).
3. **Sequence the work.** Route fundamentals to `jpube-identification-strategy` / `jpube-data-analysis` (e.g., re-do the bunching counterfactual, add a modern DID estimator, propagate SEs into the MVPF), update exhibits, *then* write the letter.
4. **Settle with a check, not a fight.** If a robustness check resolves a referee concern, run it; reserve disagreement for where the referee is genuinely mistaken.

## Response-letter structure

- **Opening:** thank the editor and reviewers; summarize the main changes briefly.
- **Point-by-point:** quote each comment, then respond with what you did and exactly where it now appears (section/table/figure/page).
- **Disagreements:** state the point fairly, give the evidence-based reason you differ, and offer a compromise (e.g., an appendix robustness check).
- **Tone:** gracious, concrete, never defensive — and remember reviewers see your identity.

## Appeals (use sparingly)

Elsevier's Appeal Policy allows **one appeal per submission**. If a paper is rejected on a clear factual or procedural error, you may appeal once — calm, specific, evidence-based, addressed to the editor. Do not spend the single appeal relitigating a taste judgment.

## Checklist

- [ ] Editor's binding points decoded and used to rank responses
- [ ] Every referee comment classified (fundamental / clarification / disagreement)
- [ ] Fundamental requests resolved with actual new analysis, not promises
- [ ] Each response cites the exact location of the change
- [ ] Disagreements are evidence-based and offer a compromise
- [ ] Revised manuscript updated *before* the letter was written
- [ ] Appeal, if any, reserved for a clear error and used at most once

## Anti-patterns

- Writing the response letter before the manuscript reflects the changes
- Promising future work instead of doing the analysis this round
- Arguing where a quick robustness check (bunching counterfactual, DID estimator) would settle it
- Burning the single appeal on a taste disagreement
- A defensive tone — recall the specialist reviewers know who you are
