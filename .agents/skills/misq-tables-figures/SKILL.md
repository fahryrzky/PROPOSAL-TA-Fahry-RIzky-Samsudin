name: misq-tables-figures
description: Use when designing the exhibits for a MIS Quarterly manuscript — measurement/correlation and structural-model tables for behavioral IS, regression and robustness tables for economics-of-IS, artifact architecture and evaluation exhibits for design science, and a Gioia-style data structure for qualitative work — all sized to fit MISQ's page limit, which counts tables and figures. Late-stage polish; do not run before the contribution and evaluation are settled.

# Tables & Figures (misq-tables-figures)

## When to trigger

- Exhibits are cluttered, off-style, or not self-explanatory
- Tables and figures are eating the page budget (the limit counts them)
- A reviewer cannot reconstruct your model, identification, or artifact from the exhibits
- You are at the polish stage with a settled contribution

## Every exhibit costs page budget

Unlike journals that exclude exhibits from the limit, MISQ page limits **count text, tables, figures, references, and appendices together**, and supplementary materials are discouraged. So each exhibit must earn its space: consolidate, remove decorative figures, and keep only what carries the argument. Plan the exhibit set against the category budget (e.g., 50 pp for a Research Article).

## Choose exhibits by tradition

| Tradition | Core exhibits |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Behavioral** | Construct correlation table (reliabilities on the diagonal), measurement-model table (loadings, AVE, CR), structural-model figure with path coefficients, simple-slopes plot for moderation |
| **Economics of IS** | Descriptives/balance table, main regression table, robustness table, an event-study/parallel-trends figure |
| **Design science** | Artifact architecture/process figure, design-principles-to-requirements table, evaluation table (artifact vs. baselines), ablation table |
| **Organizational / qualitative** | Gioia-style data structure (first-order codes → second-order themes → aggregate dimensions), a process model figure, a table of representative quotations |

## Make each exhibit self-contained

A reviewer should understand a table or figure without hunting through the text: complete titles, defined variables/constructs, units, sample size, and notes for estimator, SE clustering, and significance. For design-science evaluation tables, name the baselines and the metric. Follow the MISQ Style Guide for table/figure presentation and APA 7th conventions.

## Figures that carry the contribution

- A clean structural/path model or theoretical-model figure for behavioral/organizational papers.
- An event-study/coefficient plot for economics-of-IS identification.
- An architecture or build-and-evaluate cycle diagram for design science.
Avoid 3-D effects, chartjunk, and figures that merely restate a table.

## Checklist

- [ ] Exhibit set fits the category page budget (tables/figures count)
- [ ] Each table/figure is self-explanatory with full notes
- [ ] Behavioral: correlation/measurement tables and a structural-model figure included
- [ ] Economics: main + robustness tables and an identification figure
- [ ] Design science: architecture figure, design-principles table, evaluation/ablation tables
- [ ] Qualitative: a Gioia-style data structure exhibit
- [ ] APA 7 / MISQ Style Guide formatting

## Anti-patterns

- Padding the manuscript with figures that restate tables — wasting scarce page budget.
- Tables with undefined variables or missing SE/clustering notes.
- A design-science evaluation table with no baseline column.
- Beautifying exhibits before the model, identification, or evaluation is final.
