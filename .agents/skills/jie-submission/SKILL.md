name: jie-submission
description: Use when running the final pre-submission preflight for the Journal of International Economics (JIE) via Elsevier's Editorial Manager — the non-refundable submission fee, the regular/short/PRP Article Type choice, the 150-word abstract, 1-7 keywords, suggesting a fitting (Co-)Editor, and reference completeness. Final checks; it does not draft content.

# Submission Preflight (jie-submission)

## When to trigger

- "Submitting tomorrow" — last check before pressing submit on Editorial Manager
- Deciding between a regular, short, or Prior Review Process (PRP) submission
- Confirming the abstract, keywords, and reference completeness are JIE-compliant
- Making sure the submission fee and editor-suggestion steps are handled

## Process facts (verified 2026-06-01; re-confirm on the official guide)

- JIE is published by **Elsevier**; submission is through **Editorial Manager**. Co-Editors-in-Chief are **Martin Uribe (Columbia)** and **Costas Arkolakis (Yale)**; other editors include Jonathan Eaton, Charles Engel, Andres Rodriguez-Clare, and Robert W. Staiger.
- There is a **non-refundable submission fee of USD 190 / EUR 169.20 / JPY 20,660**, reduced to **USD 95 when every author is a PhD student**; VAT is added for authors in relevant European countries. Fee revenue funds JIE summer schools and the biennial **Jagdish Bhagwati Award** for the best paper in the journal.
- **Submission types**: regular, **short**, or **PRP**. For PRP, attach the editorial decision letter and referee reports from a rejection at **AER, Econometrica, JPE, QJE, or Review of Economic Studies** and select **'PRP' from the Article Type menu** — no extra fee versus a regular submission.
- **Abstract ≤ 150 words**, concise/factual, single paragraph, references avoided (cite author(s)/year(s) only if essential). Provide **1-7 keywords**.
- Authors are advised to **suggest a (Co-)Editor whose profile fits** the paper (trade vs international macro/finance).
- Reference style is applied by Elsevier **at the proof stage**; submit in any consistent style as long as required elements are present (DOIs encouraged).
- Length/word limits and the peer-review anonymization model are **待核实** — do not assert a number; check the live guide.

## Preflight checklist

### Article Type & fit
- [ ] Type chosen: **regular / short / PRP** (PRP only if you hold a qualifying AER/EMA/JPE/QJE/REStud letter + reports)
- [ ] If PRP: decision letter and referee reports attached; 'PRP' selected as Article Type
- [ ] Suggested **(Co-)Editor** whose profile matches the paper's trade or macro/finance focus

### Format & style
- [ ] Abstract is a single factual paragraph, **≤ 150 words**, references avoided
- [ ] **1-7 keywords** provided; field-discoverable
- [ ] References complete (author names, title, year, volume, article number/pages); **DOIs** added where available
- [ ] Tables and figures numbered, called out in order, with self-contained notes
- [ ] JEL codes prepared (standard for econ; 待核实 against the official guide)

### Files & declarations
- [ ] Manuscript file plus any online appendix staged for Editorial Manager
- [ ] Cover letter (concise: question, method, headline result, trade-vs-macro fit, suggested editor)
- [ ] Replication code + data staged for the JIE secure repository (see jie-replication-and-data-policy)
- [ ] Conflict-of-interest / funding disclosures prepared; confirmed not under review elsewhere

### Fee
- [ ] Submission fee budgeted: **USD 190 / EUR 169.20 / JPY 20,660** (USD 95 if all authors are PhD students); VAT noted for European authors

## Anti-patterns

- Treating the fee as refundable or skipping it (submission will not proceed)
- Selecting PRP without a qualifying letter from one of the five named journals
- A 250-word, citation-laden abstract (cap is 150 words, references avoided)
- Not suggesting an editor, so trade work lands with a macro editor or vice versa
- Asserting a word limit the official guide does not confirm (待核实)
