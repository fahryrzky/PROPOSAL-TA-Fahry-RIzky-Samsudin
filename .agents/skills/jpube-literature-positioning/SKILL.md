name: jpube-literature-positioning
description: Use when positioning a Journal of Public Economics (JPubE) manuscript against the public-finance literature — locating the contribution relative to the tax, social-insurance, public-expenditure, and optimal-policy frontier without writing a standalone survey. Positions the paper; it does not frame the core contribution (use jpube-contribution-framing).

# Literature Positioning (jpube-literature-positioning)

## When to trigger

- The related-work section reads like a survey, not a staking of claim
- You cannot name the two or three papers you are directly building on or beating
- A reviewer might say "this has been done" or "the optimal-tax connection is missing"
- You are unsure which strand of public economics owns your question

## Positioning at JPubE

JPubE referees are public-finance specialists, and they judge the **contribution against the field's own frontier**, not against general economics. Position the paper inside the relevant strand and against the canonical references that define it:

- **Taxable-income / elasticity strand** — Feldstein-style ETI, the Saez–Slemrod–Giertz synthesis, bunching-based elasticity estimates. Say which estimate yours updates and why.
- **Optimal taxation** — the Mirrlees / Diamond–Saez sufficient-statistics tradition. If you estimate a sufficient statistic, connect it explicitly to the optimal-policy formula it feeds.
- **Social insurance** — the Baily–Chetty optimal-UI / insurance-vs.-moral-hazard frontier; the MVPF welfare-comparison program. State which trade-off your evidence sharpens.
- **Public goods, externalities, fiscal federalism** — Samuelson/Pigou foundations and modern corrective-policy evidence.

Locate your contribution as a precise delta on this frontier: a better-identified parameter, a new margin, a setting that tests external validity, or a theoretical extension.

## Positioning moves

- **Name the frontier paper you advance**, then state your one-sentence delta over it.
- **Distinguish identification, not just topic.** "Prior work used cross-sectional variation; we use a reform discontinuity" is a JPubE-legible improvement.
- **Connect estimates to the policy framework** they discipline (optimal tax / optimal UI / MVPF) so referees see the contribution's reach.
- **Cite within the field, author-date.** JPubE uses name-and-year references; integrate citations into the argument rather than a list.

## Checklist

- [ ] The relevant public-economics strand is named explicitly
- [ ] Two or three frontier papers you build on / improve are identified
- [ ] Your one-sentence delta over each is stated
- [ ] The improvement is in identification or welfare reach, not just a new dataset
- [ ] Citations are author-date and woven into the argument, not a standalone survey

## Anti-patterns

- A chronological literature dump with no stated delta
- Positioning against general economics instead of the public-finance frontier
- Claiming novelty while ignoring the canonical optimal-tax / optimal-UI reference
- "First paper to study X in country Y" as the entire contribution
