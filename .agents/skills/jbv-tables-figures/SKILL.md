name: jbv-tables-figures
description: Use when building or cleaning the exhibits for a Journal of Business Venturing (JBV) manuscript — venture descriptive/correlation tables, survival curves, interaction plots, process models, and qualitative data structures in Elsevier house style. Late-stage polish; do not invoke while the entrepreneurial mechanism or identification is still unsettled (use jbv-theory-development / jbv-data-analysis first).

# Tables & Figures (jbv-tables-figures)

## When to trigger

- Tables/figures are cluttered, redundant, or not self-explanatory
- You need the standard exhibit set for an entrepreneurship empirical paper
- A reviewer says an exhibit is "not interpretable" or "off house style"
- You are presenting survival, interaction, or qualitative-process results

## JBV exhibit conventions

JBV publishes via Elsevier/ScienceDirect, so prepare figures for both print and online, with self-contained captions and consistent author–date in-text references. Each exhibit must stand alone: a reader should grasp it without the text.

## The standard exhibit set (match to your design)

- **Table 1 — Descriptives & correlations**: venture-level means, SDs, and correlations; note the sampling frame (e.g., Crunchbase/PSED) and the time window. Flag survivorship in the note if the sample conditions on survival.
- **Table 2+ — Main models**: nested model columns; report coefficients with SEs, the SE-clustering level (cohort/region/industry), and fit. For **survival models** report hazard ratios with a clear baseline and the risk set; for **selection models** show both the selection and outcome equations.
- **Interaction plots**: when you theorize moderation by an entrepreneurial condition (uncertainty, resource scarcity, ecosystem support), plot simple slopes with a clear region of significance — do not leave the interaction to a coefficient alone.
- **Survival/Kaplan-Meier curves**: for time-to-IPO/exit/failure, show curves by key group with at-risk counts.
- **Process model / framework figure**: a boxes-and-arrows model of the entrepreneurial mechanism (opportunity → action → outcome) — earns its place only if it adds beyond the text.
- **Qualitative data structure**: for inductive work, a Gioia-style figure (first-order codes → second-order themes → aggregate dimensions) plus a power-quote table.

## Quality bar

- Every table note defines abbreviations, significance stars, SE type, and N (and venture-level vs. event-level units).
- Figures are legible in grayscale; lines/markers distinguishable without color.
- No exhibit duplicates the text; no number in a table contradicts the prose.
- Units and scales are stated (e.g., USD funding, log employees, months-to-exit).

## Checklist

- [ ] Descriptives/correlation table with frame, window, and survivorship note
- [ ] Main-model table reports SEs, clustering level, fit; HRs/selection eqs if used
- [ ] Interaction plotted with simple slopes + significance region
- [ ] Survival curves with at-risk counts where time-to-event is the outcome
- [ ] Process model or framework figure earns its place (adds beyond text)
- [ ] Qualitative data structure + power quotes for inductive work
- [ ] Self-contained captions; grayscale-legible; no text duplication

## Anti-patterns

- **Coefficient-only moderation** with no simple-slope plot.
- **Mega-table** dumping every model and control with no narrative.
- **Color-only figures** that collapse in print.
- **Decorative framework figure** that merely restates the abstract.
